# Introduction to Deep Rewiring in tensorflow
This repository provides basic implementations of Deep Rewiring in Tensorflow. The scripts are showing how to solve Mnist with networks that are kept very sparse all along the training (less than 2% of the connections are active). Two algorithms are implemented: Deep R and soft-Deep R. Mathematical prooves and more advanced simulations are described in our paper.
